REFLECTION


For Programming Techniques 1 I realized that doing practical coding exercises improved my understanding of how to apply the techniques in real-world situations. I also discovered that having a strong curiosity and wanting to learn more is essential. It is just like a loop, exercises make me curious, and curiosity motivates me to explore more. This drives me to want to become someone who can solve actual programming problems.

REFLECTION


Assignment 1 ( Poster HABIB&PPG) 
Thanks to Habib and PPG, I learned how important information and communication technology (ICT) is in many different industries. My interest in a profession in information and communications technology was sparked by the chance for creative problem-solving and practical benefits.
The presentation demonstrated the wide range of job opportunities in the business while outlining the numerous applications of ICT. Knowing this has increased my confidence to take part in several events that will enhance my résumé. I'm eager to acquire the technical and soft skills necessary for success in my future profession.

Assignment 2 (Video UTM DIGITAL) 
I participated in a Webex-based virtual discussion on UTM Digital on December 5, 2023. Our visit at UTM Digital took place on December 13, 2023. We learned about the goal, vision, and range of ICT services offered by UTMDIGITAL during the session. We saw their innovative products during the tour, including Huawei IdeaHub in Bilik TM and cybersecurity solutions. Through these events, I was able to network, make connections between theory and reality, and develop my interest in technology. They also made the course content more enjoyable and memorable by providing real-world scenarios that improved my knowledge of it.
Assignment 3 (ACADEMIC WRITING REPORT) 
This talk has given me a very clear picture. My primary goal for the next four years will be to keep learning new things to become a proficient system developer. This entails keeping up with the newest programming languages and technological advancements while continuously upgrading my knowledge and abilities. I understand how critical it is to be proactive and actively engage in continuing education and training. By doing this, I can make sure that my skill set is adaptable and in line with the rapidly evolving field of system development. My commitment to learning shows that I have a forward-thinking outlook and sets me up for success.
Assignment 4 (NEWSLETTER) 
It was a fantastic chance to attend an industry seminar at PETRONAS for first-year data engineering students, which was arranged by the UTM Faculty of Computing. My perspectives were widened by being introduced to novel topics in the ICT industry, such as drones and PETRONAS Cloud solutions, which are rarely discussed in the classroom. I discovered how innovation—like these technologies—improves processes across industries, speeds up data accessibility, and boosts productivity. My goals for future jobs were inspired by the tour, which connected them with fascinating prospects in the ICT sector.

PC Assemble (Lab) 
Assembling the PC was a lot of fun. I learned a lot about how a PC is assembled and disassembled PC as well as how various components function together, such as the motherboard and CPU. For the computer to function effectively, the wires needed to be arranged correctly. I now feel more comfortable using technology. All in all, it was an excellent hands-on experience that gave me a lot of practical computer knowledge.
Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype)
My main goal is to do well academically in the Technology and Information System course, with a focus on developing practical skills and gaining a thorough comprehension of the material. In the end, I hope to contribute to the technology sector through original research, creative problem-solving, or effective system management. My aims have been much improved by design thinking since it prioritizes real-world problem-solving and fosters user-centered solutions. The creation of the feature-rich and user-friendly EzGo app is a prime example of this methodology and how design thinking fosters innovative problem-solving. I intend to grow my professional network by participating in online forums, seminars, and industry leadership to advance my industry potential. My quest for practical experience in real-world projects and the acquisition of new certificates are essential components of my ongoing education and skill development

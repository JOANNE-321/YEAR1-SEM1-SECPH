REFLECTION


I'm more aware of the importance of honesty and justice in both personal and professional aspects of life now that I'm studying integrity and anti-corruption. I became aware of the harm that corruption can do to individuals and the community. The course developed a commitment to maintaining integrity in a variety of situations by encouraging me to adopt ethical behavior and oppose corruption. In summary, the knowledge gained has been enlightening and has influenced my understanding of the value of integrity and the part that each person can play in creating an atmosphere free from corruption.
